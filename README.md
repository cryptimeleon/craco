## Craco

Craco (CRyptogrAphic COnstructions) is a Java library providing implementations of various cryptographic primitives and low-level constructions. This includes primitives such as commitment schemes, signature schemes, facilities for implementing multi-party protocols, and much more.

The goal of Craco is to provide common cryptographic schemes for usage in more high-level protocols as well as to offer facilities for improving the process of implementing more low-level schemes such as signature and encryption schemes.

## Security Disclaimer
**WARNING: This library is meant to be used for prototyping and as a research tool *only*. It has not been sufficiently vetted for use in security-critical production environments. All implementations are to be considered experimental.**

## Features

Craco implements interfaces and test classes for basic cryptographic primitives such as commitment schemes, encryption schemes, and more.
It also includes implementations of several schemes as well as facilities for implementing two-party protocols.

### Implemented Schemes
The constructions we implement are:

* **Accumulators**:
    * Nguyen's dynamic accumulator [Ngu05]
* **Commitment schemes**:
    * Pedersen's commitment scheme [Ped92]
* **Digital signature schemes**:
    * Pointcheval & Sanders' short randomizable signature scheme [PS16]
    * An extension of Boneh, Boyen and Shacham's signature scheme from [Eid15]
    * Pointcheval & Sanders' modified short randomizable signature scheme (with and without ROM) [PS18]
    * Fuchsbauer, Hanser and Slamanig's structure-preserving signature scheme on equivalence classes [FHS19]
* **Encryption schemes**:
    * ElGamal
    * Streaming AES Encryption using CBC and GCM modes of operation
* **Key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM)**: 
    * ElGamal
* **Secret sharing schemes**:
    * Shamir's secret sharing scheme [Sha79] and its tree extension
    
### Protocols

Craco also includes interfaces and basic classes useful for implementing cryptographic two-party protocols.
Parts of this are facilities for easy implementation of Sigma protocols.

Furthermore, it includes:

* A Fiat-Shamir transformation implementation
* A Schnorr protocol implementation
* An implementation of Damgård's technique used to improve Sigma protocols

## Quickstart

### Installation With Maven
To add the newest Craco version as a dependency, add this to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.cryptimeleon</groupId>
    <artifactId>craco</artifactId>
    <version>[4.0,)</version>
</dependency>
```

### Installation With Gradle

Craco is published via Maven Central.
Therefore, you need to add `mavenCentral()` to the `repositories` section of your project's `build.gradle` file.
Then, add `implementation group: 'org.cryptimeleon', name: 'craco', version: '4.+'` to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file.

For example:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation group: 'org.cryptimeleon', name: 'craco', version: '4.+'
}
```

### Tutorials

Craco is very much connected with our [Math library](https://github.com/cryptimeleon/math).
Therefore, we recommend you go through our [short Math tutorial](https://cryptimeleon.github.io/getting-started/5-minute-tutorial.html) to get started.

We also provide walkthroughs where we show you how to implement a pairing-based signature scheme [here](https://cryptimeleon.github.io/getting-started/pairing-tutorial.html) as well as a simple cryptographic protocol [here](https://cryptimeleon.github.io/getting-started/protocols-tutorial.html).
The latter uses Craco's protocol capabilities.
